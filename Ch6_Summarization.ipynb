    "> Transfer learning, where a model is first pre-trained on a data-rich task before being fine-tuned on a downstream task, has emerged as a powerful technique in natural language processing (NLP). The effectiveness of transfer learning has given rise to a diversity of approaches, methodology, and practice. In this paper, we explore the landscape of transfer learning techniques for NLP by introducing a unified framework that converts all text-based language problems into a text-to-text format. Our systematic study compares pre-training objectives, architectures, unlabeled data sets, transfer approaches, and other factors on dozens of language understanding tasks. By combining the insights from our exploration with scale and our new \"Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus\", we achieve state-of-the-art results on many benchmarks covering summarization, question answering, text classification, and more. To facilitate future work on transfer learning for NLP, we release our data set, pre-trained models, and code. \n",

    "> ... BART, a denoising autoencoder for pretraining sequence-to-sequence models. BART is trained by (1) corrupting text with an arbitrary noising function, and (2) learning a model to reconstruct the original text. It uses a standard Tranformer-based neural machine translation architecture which, despite its simplicity, can be seen as generalizing BERT (due to the bidirectional encoder), GPT (with the left-to-right decoder), and many other more recent pretraining schemes. We evaluate a number of noising approaches, finding the best performance by both randomly shuffling the order of the original sentences and using a novel in-filling scheme, where spans of text are replaced with a single mask token. BART is particularly effective when fine tuned for text generation but also works well for comprehension tasks. It matches the performance of RoBERTa with comparable training resources on GLUE and SQuAD, achieves new state-of-the-art results on a range of abstractive dialogue, question answering, and summarization tasks, with gains of up to 6 ROUGE. BART also provides a 1.1 BLEU increase over a back-translation system for machine translation, with only target language pretraining. We also report ablation experiments that replicate other pretraining schemes within the BART framework, to better measure which factors most influence end-task performance. \n",

    "\n",
    "> Recent work pre-training Transformers with self-supervised objectives on large text corpora has shown great success when fine-tuned on downstream NLP tasks including text summarization. However, pre-training objectives tailored for abstractive text summarization have not been explored. Furthermore there is a lack of systematic evaluation across diverse domains. In this work, we propose pre-training large Transformer-based encoder-decoder models on massive text corpora with a new self-supervised objective. In PEGASUS, important sentences are removed/masked from an input document and are generated together as one output sequence from the remaining sentences, similar to an extractive summary. We evaluated our best PEGASUS model on 12 downstream summarization tasks spanning news, science, stories, instructions, emails, patents, and legislative bills. Experiments demonstrate it achieves state-of-the-art performance on all 12 downstream datasets measured by ROUGE scores. Our model also shows surprising performance on low-resource summarization, surpassing previous state-of-the-art results on 6 datasets with only 1000 examples. Finally we validated our results using human evaluation and show that our model summaries achieve human performance on multiple datasets. \n",

    "* The BLEU metric is based primarily on [_precision_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_and_negative_predictive_valueshttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_and_negative_predictive_values)<p/>\n",
    "* It only really pays attention to how many n-grams in the _references_ (hopefully human-generated examples of good translations) show up in the translation (generated text).</p>\n",
    "* It takes the geometric mean of precision calculated with respect to several n-grams, usually 1-grams through 4-grams. <p/><p/><span style=\"padding-left:1.5em\">e.g., $p_{n} = \\frac{\\sum_{\\text{n-gram } \\in \\text{ reference}} \\underset{clip}{\\text{Count(n-gram)}}}{ \\sum_{\\text{n-gram } \\in \\text{ translation}} \\text{Count(n-gram)}}$</span><br/><br/><span style=\"padding-left:1.5em\">and so $\\text{BLEU-4} \\sim \\sqrt[4]{p_{1} \\cdot p_{2} \\cdot p_{3} \\cdot p_{4}}$</span><p/>\n",
    "* It also penalizes shorter translations by scaling the above-mentioned geometric mean of the n-grams with a brevity penalty ranging from `0.0` to `1.0`.<br/><span style=\"padding-left:1.5em\">e.g., $\\text{BP} = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{ if } c \\gt r \\\\ e^{1 - \\frac{r}{c}} & \\text{ if } c \\leq r \\end{cases}$</span><br/>where $r$ is the effective reference corpus length and $c$ is the length of the candidate translation.<p/>\n",

    "* Plain-vanilla BLEU assumes that the translation and reference sentences are already tokenized, with the tokenization corresponding to single words. But different models may use different tokenization schemes, so that is why `sacrebleu` is currently preferred over `bleu`. For that reason, it is also the case that `bleu`/`sacrebleu` might not work very well with non-English languages, where tokenization may be happening at the morpheme-level.\n",

Linguists were asked to create conversations similar to those they write on a daily basis, reflecting the proportion of topics of their real-life messenger convesations. The style and register are diversified - conversations could be informal, semi-formal or formal, they may contain slang words, emoticons and typos. Then, the conversations were annotated with summaries. It was assumed that summaries should be a concise brief of what people talked about in the conversation in third person.
